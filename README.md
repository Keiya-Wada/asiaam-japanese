This project deals with the memories of people in our local Japantown, the San Jose Japantown. We want to create a map that helps preserve and archive the memories of Japanese American citizens that will become forever lost if we don't digitalize them. The ethical problem that we are trying to solve the is preventing the pernament loss of information, tradition, and culture. This map will benefit the Japanese American elderly people, and ensure that their knowledge is passed down and preserved. As evident with the fact that only three Japantowns remain in the U.S, we want to save Japantown from extinction and archive important personal memories of tragedies like ww2 and the incarceration camps.

We will be surveing the elderly people and gather data of their age, name, etc. But one problem that we might face is to be specific in what it is that we want to ask. Another problem is to make sure that the data we are receiving is authentic, and making sure we are allowing the elders to write about what they want to truly save. As elders may not be as proficient in technology as us, we also want to make sure that we create a survey that is really easy to understand and is straightforward.
