This project deals with the memories of people in our local Japantown, the San Jose Japantown. We want to create a map that helps preserve and archive the memories of Japanese American citizens that will become forever lost if we don't digitalize them. The ethical problem that we are trying to solve the is preventing the pernament loss of information, tradition, and culture. This map will benefit the Japanese American elderly people, and ensure that their knowledge is passed down and preserved.
